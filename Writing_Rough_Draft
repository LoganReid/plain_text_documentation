Neutron stars are very strange. They are very dense. This paper will talk more about origin and traits of neutron stars.

Neutron stars are the product of the collapse of other stars that are 8 times our sun’s mass. Once fuel for fusion runs out, star collapses. Electrons and protons combine and release energy, ejecting mass outside of core. Result is just bundle of neutrons called neutron star.

Neutron stars have a very strange composition. They have 1.4 to 5 times our sun’s mass but only 7 mile diameter. They are 3x10^14 times denser than our sun, with gravity about 10^11 times stronger than on earth. Approach at half the speed of light. Rotate in 2 milliseconds. This means surface speed is 40 million mph.

These stars eject radiation from poles. These types of stars are called pulsars. Energy released is due to particle acceleration. Poles are 10^15 times stronger than earth magnetically. Using this radation is how we find neutron stars.

Neutron stars are very chaotic. They have fast speeds, high density, and high gravity. Release energy from poles. Some of the strangest objects in the universe.
