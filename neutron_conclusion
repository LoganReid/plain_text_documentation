	Neutron stars are the product of the collapse of large solar masses. They are extremely dense, consisting almost entierly of neutrons, hence the name. These stars have almost the same mass as our sun, but are condensed down to the size of the greater Seattle area. This is so dense that a sugar cube sized portion of one would way millions of tons. Additionally, neutron stars will often oscillate and emit large quantities of energy, in which case they are known as pulsars. Overall, neutron stars are some of the most dense and high energy objects in the universe.
